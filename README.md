# Treasure-Seeker

This is a series of Mini Projects I have been working on during a Summer Immersion Program. 
It's incomplete and a bit faulty. 
As well as extremely short and strange. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
They all consist of odd walkthrough games, I'd like to one day create a short version of a storyline game. 
With multiple personas!
Example: Pick your narrator.
         Pick your animal helper.
         Hints/No hint?
         etc.
